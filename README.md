# Springer Journal Crawler

The journal list was fetched from http://www.springerprotocols.com/cdp/view/Series?issn=1940-6061&sortBy=CATEGORY&submit=Go

I manually parsed the DOIs from it, making articles.csv file.

Python script calls bash shell script and fetches all the journals.

### Requirements
